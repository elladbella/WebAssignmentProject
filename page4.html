  <h1><center> ABOUT ME</center></h1>
    <p>
      <br>Hi! I go by Dias. I'm 25 years old, and I am a Scorpio born on November 3rd.<br/>
    <br>I was born and raised in Brazil until the age of 12. That means my native language is Portuguese!<br/>
    <br>It is my second semester at BMCC as a Computer Science major. I want to be a software developer, as well as have working knowledge of creating CGI for an animated movie and game I plan to make.<br/>
    <br>Overall, I am pretty happy I chose to start at this school after taking several years off since high school.<br/>
    <br>The only pet peeve I have is the amount of math I need to take to graduate (up to Calculus II, yikes!)<br/>
